I'm a student currently learning C++. I have some previous experience in Java and Python, although not much (I've probably forgotten Python entirely by now). I intend to learn more about how this site works and will probably be uploading more repositories throughout this semester of basic C++ code. Game design has been on my mind for a minute, but I know I have a long way to go before that might be a realistic endeavor.
